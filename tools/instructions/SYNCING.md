# Syncing project-os template updates

Use this when the project-os template lives outside the dev repo and you want to pull updates safely.

## Template-owned (safe to sync)
- `tools/instructions/`
- `tools/skills/`
- `tools/agents/`
- `tools/adapters/`
- `tools/cockpit/`
- `tools/scripts/`
- `docs/__templates__/`
- `docs/__bases__/`
- `docs/phases/`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASES.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `LLM_BRIEF.md`
- Optional: `SECURITY.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
- Optional seed only: `docs/reference/README.md` when the downstream file does not already exist

## Project-owned (do NOT overwrite)
- `SNAPSHOT.yaml`
- `docs/features/`
- `docs/issues/`
- `docs/requirements/`
- `docs/tests/`
- `docs/changes/`
- `docs/decisions/`
- `docs/workflows/` (except template updates you explicitly choose to merge)
- `docs/reference/`
- `docs/research/`
- Other project-specific docs subdirectories
- Runtime artifacts produced by `tools/cockpit/run.sh`, such as `tools/cockpit/.venv/`

`docs/changes/` is intentionally project-owned: upstream template change notes describe the evolution of project-os itself, while downstream change notes describe the downstream project after init. Keep those histories separate unless a downstream project deliberately imports upstream template history for audit purposes.

`docs/reference/` and other non-lifecycle docs areas are intentionally project-owned: upstream may provide a starter README, but downstream projects use these areas for source, evidence, registry, background, research, and publication material. Template sync must not overwrite them.

## Recommended flow
1. Pull latest upstream project-os.
2. Run `tools/scripts/sync-project-os.sh <path-to-upstream>`.
3. Review changes (git diff).
4. Run `tools/skills/snapshot-sync/SKILL.md`.
