# Acceptance test rules

This document defines the acceptance test tier system, lifecycle rules, and release gating requirements.

## Acceptance test tiers

### Tier 1 — Feature Tests (permanent)
- Verify core user-facing capabilities.
- One or more tests per feature (linked via `FEAT-*` in section headers).
- Always relevant. Never removed.
- Created when a feature is first implemented.

### Tier 2 — Regression Tests (permanent)
- Guard against previously-broken behavior.
- Each references the `ISS-*` that created it.
- Kept permanently — these test edge cases that feature tests don't cover.
- Created when a bug fix is implemented.

### Tier 3 — Verification Tests (temporary)
- One-time checks for a specific build or fix.
- After a verified release, each is either:
  - **Promoted** to Tier 2 if the scenario could regress
  - **Removed** if covered by unit tests or the fix is stable (one-liner, config change)
- Include a note explaining why they're temporary and what unit tests cover them.

## Lifecycle rules

### When to create
1. **New feature implemented** → create Tier 1 test(s) covering the user-visible behavior.
2. **Bug fixed** → create a Tier 2 test that reproduces the original bug and verifies the fix.
3. **One-time verification needed** → create a Tier 3 test with a note about removal criteria.

### When to uncheck (mark for re-run)
- Any code change must uncheck all Tier 1 and Tier 2 tests whose scope overlaps with the changed code.
- Use judgment: a change to `WorkoutViewModel` unchecks workout tests, not Bluetooth tests.

### When to remove
- **Tier 3 tests** are removed after a verified release if:
  - They are covered by passing unit tests, OR
  - The fix is a stable one-liner unlikely to regress, OR
  - The scenario was a one-time data/config fix
- **Tier 1 and Tier 2 tests** are never removed (only deprecated if the feature is retired).

### Unit test replacement
- When unit tests are written that cover the same logic as an acceptance test, the acceptance test can be moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3.
- Add a note to the Tier 3 section: "Covered by `<TestClassName>` (<N> tests). Remove after next release."
- After the next verified release, remove the Tier 3 test.

## Acceptance test document structure

The acceptance test document (`docs/tests/ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md`) should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Acceptance Test Suite: <Project> v<version>

## Test Tiers
<!-- Tier definitions and rules summary -->

## Rules
<!-- Numbered rules for create/uncheck/remove/gate -->

---

# Tier 1 — Feature Tests

## 1.1 <Area> (<FEAT-IDs>)
- [x] **Test Name:** Test procedure and expected result.

---

# Tier 2 — Regression Tests

## 2.1 <Bug Area> (<ISS-ID>)
- [x] **Test Name:** Test procedure and expected result.

---

# Tier 3 — Verification Tests (current build)
<!-- Temporary tests. Remove after verified release. -->

---

# Test Execution Notes
<!-- Prerequisites, environment setup -->

# Release History
<!-- Build notes per version -->
```

## Release gating

- A release is **blocked** if any Tier 1 or Tier 2 test is unchecked (not passing).
- Tier 3 tests do not gate releases (they are verification aids, not requirements).
- A test may be marked as a **release exception** if it cannot be completed (e.g., third-party API key unavailable). Exceptions must be documented in the release note with justification.

## Relationship to TST-* notes

- `TST-*` notes in `docs/tests/` or `docs/features/<slug>/plan/tests/` are individual test specifications with frontmatter, preconditions, procedures, and evidence.
- `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md` is a consolidated checklist for manual acceptance testing — it references features and issues but is not a `TST-*` note itself.
- Both systems coexist: `TST-*` notes for formal test tracking, `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md` for the release checklist.
