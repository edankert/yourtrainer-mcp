# Template schemas (frontmatter fields)

This document defines the intended meaning of the frontmatter fields used by the note templates in `docs/__templates__/`.

Conventions (naming, linking, property rules): `../../tools/instructions/OBSIDIAN.md`.

## Common fields (most templates)

- (required) `type` (link string): Obsidian link identifying the note type, e.g. `type: "[[task]]"`.
  - Used by tools/automation to classify notes; the snapshot references these types.
- (required) `id` (string): Stable identifier (should match the filename prefix).
  - Used for traceability and for `SNAPSHOT.yaml` keys.
- (recommended) `title` (string): Human-friendly title for views and summaries.
  - Keep short; no need to repeat the ID.
  - Keep it consistent with `SNAPSHOT.yaml` where possible.
- (required) `status` (string): Lifecycle state; each note type has its own allowed values.
- (optional) `phase` (link or integer): Development phase for milestone grouping. Prefer `[[PHASE-####]]` links when using first-class phase notes; legacy integer values may be used during migration. See `[[PHASES]]` for definitions.
  - Enables machine-filtering, automated progress tracking, and phase grouping.
  - Leave empty/omit for items not tied to a specific phase.
- (required) `owner` (string): Accountable person/team (can be `unassigned`).
  - Values must be defined in `[[OWNERSHIP]]` (or be `unassigned`).
- (required) `created` (date string): Creation date; keep stable.
- (required) `updated` (date string): Last material edit date; bump when meaningfully changed.
- (optional) `related` (list of links/strings): Cross-links to other notes and/or repo paths.
  - Prefer links (`[[...]]`) when pointing to other notes in this docs set.
- (optional) `source` (list of strings/links): Provenance for imported/derived items.
  - Use for links to external trackers, changelogs, or source documents.
